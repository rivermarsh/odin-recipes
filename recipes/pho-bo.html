        <ul>
            <li>600g scotch fillet steaks</li>
            <li>1 onion peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>1 thumb size piece of fresh ginger thickly sliced</li> 
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li> 
            <li>2 whole star-anise</li> 
            <li>3 garlic cloves</li> 
            <li>1 tsp coriander seeds</li> 
            <li>1.5L beef broth</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>2 carrots cut into large chunks</li>
            <li>375g rice noodles soaked and drained</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on oven to broil/grill at max setting. Place oven rack high inside the oven. Line a tray with foil and arrange onion and ginger in 1 layer. Broil for 20 to 30 minutes until charred in some spots.</li>
        <li>Place steak in the freezer for 40 minutes to firm up. Slice thinly and set aside to bring to room temperature.</li>
        <li>While that is happening, place cinnamon, star anise, coriander seeds, peppercorns and cloves in a dry frying pan and toast on medium heat, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour broth and water into a large saucepan and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the toasted aromatics, carrots, fish sauce, brown sugar, and salt. Add charred onions and ginger. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the broth is cooking, prepare the topping ingredients and arrange into a couple of dishes.</li>
        <li>Using a mesh strainer or slotted spoon, remove and discard the solid ingredients from the broth. Season to taste. Turn the heat up and bring the broth to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Cook noodles in boiling water for 2-3 minutes. Drain and divide the hot noodles into four bowls.</li>
    </ol>
