    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I found this on foodlovers.co.nz. I haven't tried this particular recipe before, but as long as you drown it in butter i'm sure even a mediocre cheese scone is still pretty good</p>    

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 rounded cups of flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>50g butter</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1-2 cupts grated tasty cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220 C</li>
            <li>Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Rub in the butter until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Stir through the baking powder and then the cheese</li>
            <li>Make a well in the centre and add milk, mixing quickly with a knife to form a soft dough</li>
            <li>Tip dough onto a lightly floured board and pat or roll into a rectangle.</li>
            <li>Cut into shapes and brush with a little milk</li>
            <li>Place on a baking tray and cook for 12-15 minutes until a rich golden colour</li>
        </ol>
